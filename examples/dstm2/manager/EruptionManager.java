/**
 * Resolves conflicts by increasing pressure on the transactions that
 * a blocked transaction is waiting on, eventually causing them to
 * erupt through to completion. The way this works is that each time a
 * block is successfully opened, the transaction gains one point of
 * "momentum". When a transaction finds itself blocked by another of
 * higher priority, it adds its momentum (priority) to the other
 * transaction and then waits for the other transaction to complete.
 * Like the Karma manager, Eruption will only wait around so long
 * before clobbering the other transaction and going on anyway; the
 * maximum wait is proportional to the square of the difference in
 * priorities between the two transactions. Of course, at contention
 * time, if the other transaction has a lower priority, we just erupt
 * past it.
 *
 * The reasoning behind this management scheme is that if a particular
 * transaction is blocking resources critical to many other
 * transactions, it will gain all of their priority in addition to its
 * own and thus be much more likely to finish quickly and get out of
 * the way of all the others.
 *
 * Note that while a transaction is blocked, other transactions can
 * pile up behind it and increase its priority enough to outweigh the
 * transaction it's blocked behind.
