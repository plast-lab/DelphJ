/**
 * Uses "karmic debt management" to resolve conflicts.  Roughly, a
 * thread gains "karma" for every object it successfully opens, and
 * threads with greater karma can abort transactions of other threads.
 * A thread's karma is reset every time it successfully commits a
 * transaction, but not when it is aborted (hence the name).
 *
 * When conflict occurs between two transactions, the one with the
 * greater accumulated karma wins. If the other transaction holds a
 * block, it gets aborted immediately. Otherwise, the "lesser"
 * transaction backs off for a fixed interval and up to the square of
 * the difference in karma bethere the two.
 *
 * The key idea behind this policy is that it allows long transactions
 * to eventually finish even if mixed with lots of competing shorter
 * transactions. This happens because the longer transaction will
 * accumulate more and more karma each time it gets aborted, so it
 * will eventually reach "critical mass" and be able to bulldoze its
 * way through to get its work done.
