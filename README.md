DelphJ
======

DelphJ is a Java-based OO language (MorphJ with delegation features) that eschews inheritance completely, in favor of a combination of class morphing and (deep) delegation.

You can see differences between MorphJ and DelphJ with the following git command:

`git diff -w morphj..master`
